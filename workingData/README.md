## Working data

- data.csv is a copy of the atlas_db.csv file meant for manipulation. I didn’t want to work directly on the source file.
- markers_hmdb contains all the thc markers within the hmdb.org database. 
- markers_hmdb-simple contains the same thc marker data but less fields. Smaller size and less complicated, useful for audits or manipulation.
- markers_osm contains all the thc markers within the osm.org database.
- markers_osm-simple is simplified version of above. 
- Texas_Counties.kml is simply the county outlines and names for Google Earth or any GIS.
